noShieldFlairReply = """M'lord,

Sansa would have known whose heraldry you were requesting but much like Arya, I have never taken much interest in titles and sigils. Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house, I was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done.

So, I'm sorry, m'lord, I don't recognize that sigil.

Please try to choose your flair shield and text again. Remember not to alter the subject line in any way.
